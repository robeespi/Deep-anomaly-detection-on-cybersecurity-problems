# Weakly Supervised Malware Detection

Due to constantly changing speciFications, the malware detection system demands constant compliance activities to meet ever-evolving security requirements.

Neural Networks models have showed their ability to perform feature extraction from raw data. This type of algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution in order to discover intermediate feature representations to downstream tasks such as binary classiSication, multi-label classiSication or multiclassiSication. In this work, a neural network approach is implemented to identify anomalies on unstructured system logs
